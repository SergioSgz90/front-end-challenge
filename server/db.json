      "albumInfo": "Hail to the Thief is the sixth album by the English rock band Radiohead. It was released on 9 June 2003 through Parlophone internationally and a day later through Capitol Records in the United States. It was the last album released under Radiohead's record contract with EMI, the parent company of Parlophone and Capitol.  After transitioning to a more electronic style on their albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were recorded through protracted studio experimentation, Radiohead sought to work more spontaneously, combining electronic and rock music. They recorded most of Hail to the Thief in two weeks in Los Angeles with their longtime producer Nigel Godrich, focusing on live takes rather than overdubs.",

      "albumInfo": "On some kind of peace, Arnalds makes his most sophisticated record yet and it is heartbreakingly brilliant: a collection of exquisitely assembled compositions that appear delicate from a distance before revealing a close-quarters core strength. Listening to an Olafur Arnalds record is also a distinctly cinematic experience. His tracks have a way of enveloping the listener, invoking images of desolate valleys, snow-capped mountains, rolling hills. This penchant for the cinematic is no accident as it was film music that has inspired him in the first place to take this road where he would fuse different strands of ambient, classical, and film music into his own kind of expression. Indeed, fans of film scores, minimalism, avant-garde composition, ambient electronic music, and trip-hop should all find much to sink their teeth into his music. Arnalds certainly isn't the first to integrate those forms, yet his method of assembling them into a unified system is impressive enough. Although he uses several musical styles on this album as he oscillates between them, his rather broad stylistic overview does not prevent a cohesion in the compositional style.",

      "albumInfo": "Random Access Memories is the fourth studio album by the French electronic duo Daft Punk, released on 17 May 2013 through Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements, and a web series. Recording sessions took place from 2008 to 2012 at Henson, Conway and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France. Random Access Memories was the duo's final album before they split up in February 2021.",
